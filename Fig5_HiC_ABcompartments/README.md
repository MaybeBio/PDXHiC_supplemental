- `01_Analysis_dcHiC.Rmd` - Processing differential compartment results from `dcHi-C` analysis.
    - Input: Data from `dcHiC`
    - Output: A BED file with colors for each type of AB compartment change. An Excel file with genes overlapping AB compartment switches (individual worksheets), other summaries. `GenesALL` worksheet has all genes ranked by Eigenvector difference.
